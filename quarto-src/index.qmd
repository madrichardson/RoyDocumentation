title: "Documentation of Roy's Processing Scripts for SWFSC Data Servers"
---

## Welcome

This site documents Roy Mendelssohn's suite of processing scripts for SWFSC Data servers. 

Here you'll find:

- **Utility Library** (`roylib.py`):
  Library used by many of the Python scripts on saltydog.

- **MODISA Processing Scripts**
  The MODISA scripts take Level-2 (L2) MODIS-Aqua swath files for both MB (Pacific Ocean) and MW (West Coast) products, automatically downloading, filtering, gridding, and applying land masks and quality flags. They then generate CF-Compliant 1-, 3-, 8-, 14- day or monthly SST or Chlorophyll-a composite NetCDFs ready for deployment to ERDDAP. 

  - **Data Ingestion & Orchestration** (`newGetModis.py`):  
    Fetch Level-2 files, track new data, and drive the 1-day, multi-day, and monthly composite workflows for the MB and MW datasets.

  - **MB Datasets** (`make*1daynewMB.py`, `CompMB*.py`, `CompMW*mday.py`):
    Pacific Ocean SST & Chlorophyll-a scripts for making 1-, 3-, 8-, 14- day or monthly composites.

  - **MW Datasets** (`make*1daynewMW.py`, `CompMW*.py`, `CompMW*mday.py`): 
    West Coast SST & Chlorophyll-a scripts for making 1-, 3-, 8-, 14- day or monthly composites.


 - **Full API & Workflow Documentation**: 
   Sphinx-generated reference detailing every function’s docstring, script setup and configuration, command-line options, and an overview of the end-to-end workflow. [View the full API Reference](sphinx-api-website/index.html)

Use the left‐hand menu to jump to any section. Each script is tucked inside a foldable code block for easy browsing.
